# Dental-Disease-Detection
This project develops an end-to-end Dental Disease Detection system using YOLO for real-time object detection and Flask for API deployment. It processes dental X-ray images to detect and localize multiple dental conditions using bounding boxes and segmentation, returning annotated images with spatial coordinates for accurate diagnosis support.
